## Overview of Election Audit

The Colorado Board of Elections requested that an election audit be preformed on a recent local congressional election. The Board of Elections tasked me to do the following: 

    - Calculate the total number of votes cast
    - Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received 
    - Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate received
    - Calculate the number of votes cast in each county and the percentage of votes each county cast
    - Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote

## Election-Audit Summary

The Colorado Board of Elections could use this script as an outline for other elections. It could be modified to fit the needs of any election audit. One way that the script could be changed to fit another election audit is to change the county votes for loop to process state votes. This script could be changed to accomodate the data from a national election. We were only looking at 3 seperate counties, but potentially you could analyze data from all of the counties in every state. Another way to modify the script is to add a table after all of the calculations are preformed to better illustrate the data.
